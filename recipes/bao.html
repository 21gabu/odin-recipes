    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    
    <strong>Bread Dough</strong>

    <ol>
        <p><li>Mix yeast in water that is warmed up between 98 F or 36 c. Let sit for 10 minutes. </li></p>
        <p><li>In a stand mixer bowl, add the bread flour, cornstarch, sugar, and sea salt. Whisk together at first to incorporate all ingredients then add yeast and water mixture in the bowl gradually. </li></p>
        <p><li>If needed or too dry, add 1 tbsp of water but not too much. Add 2 tbsp or 28 g of softened unsalted butter or softened pork fat. </li></p>
        <p><li>Mix 8 to 10 minutes until smooth and looks cohesive, gently shape dough into a ball. In a greased bowl, put inside, damp towel, let rise for 1.5 hr or 2.5 times its size.</li></p>
    </ol>

    <strong>Char Siu Filling</strong>

    <ol>
        <p><li>Cut charsiu into small pieces. </li></p>
        <p><li>In a medium saucepot, heat cooking in medium heat. Toss in shallots, then saute until translucent. </li></p>
        <p><li>Add sugar, oyster sauce, soy sauce, water, flour and let it thicken until it looks like a glaze. </li></p>
        <p><li>Fold in char siu. Remove from the sauce pot and let cool.</li></p>

    </ol>

    <strong>Shaping</strong>

    <ol>
        <p><li>Shape dough into a long log, 18 in long. Ideally you would get 12-14 pieces of dough. </li></p>
        <p><li>Roll over the cut side. Do an 8 turn roll by rolling an eighth of the dough turning it, then rolling it again, leaving a thick center and a thin outside leaving a little bubble in the center for the filling. When rolled out with a rolling pin, the dough should be 4-5 inches in diameter. </li></p>
    <p><li>Add enough filling so that there is a half inch border around the whole bao. </li></p>
    <p><li>Pleat by pinching the dough then pressing it on the pinched edge repeatedly until the bao closes. </li></p>
    <p><li>Cut 3.5 in squares of parch paper. Put them below the bao so that they do not stick in steamer basket while cooking. </li></p>
    <p><li>Steamer basket setup: 2 inches of water and bring to a boil. Place steamer basket on top of the pot of boiling water without having the basket touch the water. 12 mins.</li></p>
